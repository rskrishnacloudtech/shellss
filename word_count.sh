# Use tr to convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, then use tr to convert all non-alphanumeric characters to newlines.
# Use sort to sort the words alphabetically, then use uniq -c to count the occurrences of each unique word.
# Use sort -nr to sort the output numerically and in reverse order (largest count first).
# Use head -n 5 to get the top 5 most frequent words.
# Finally, use awk to print the count and word separately.
